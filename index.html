        <p>
          CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more
          complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can
          help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables,
          nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that make writing
          CSS fun again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed
          Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your
          website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass
          is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the
          <code>sass</code>command. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build
          from, and where to output CSS to. For example, running
          <code>sass input.scss output.css</code> from yourterminal would take a
          single Sass file, <code>input.scss</code>, and compile that file to
          <code>output.css</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also watch individual files or directories with the --watch
          flag.
        </p>
        <p>
          The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes, and
          re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass. If you wanted to watch
          (instead of manually build) your <code>input.scss</code> file, you'd
          just add the watch flag to your command, like so:
        </p>
        <p><code>sass --watch input.scss output.css</code></p>
        <p>
          You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your
          input and output, and separating them with a colon. In this example:
        </p>
        <p><code>sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets</code></p>
        <p>
          Sass would watch all files in the app/sass folder for changes, and
          compile CSS to the public/stylesheets folder.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="variables" class="main-section">
        <header>
          Variables
        </header>
        <p>
          Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to
          reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors,
          font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass
          uses the $ symbol to make something a variable. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <p>
          SCSS
          <br />
          <code>
            $font-stack:Helvetica, sans-serif; <br />
            $primary-color: #333; <br />
            body { <br />
            font: 100% $font-stack; <br />
            color: $primary-color; <br />
            }
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Sass <br />
          <code>
            $font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif <br />
            $primary-color: #333 <br />
            body <br />
            font: 100% $font-stack <br />
            color: $primary-color
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the
          $font-stack and $primary-color and outputs normal CSS with our
          variable values placed in the CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can be extremely powerful when working with brand colors and
          keeping them consistent throughout the site.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="nesting" class="main-section">
        <header>
          Nesting
        </header>
        <p>
          When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested
          and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the
          same visual hierarchy of your HTML. Be aware that overly nested rules
          will result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain
          and is generally considered bad practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, here's an example of some typical styles for a
          site's navigation:
        </p>
        <p>
          SCSS <br />
          <code
            >nav {<br />
            ul {<br />
            margin: 0;<br />
            padding: 0;<br />
            list-style: none;<br />
            }<br />

            li { display: inline-block; }<br />

            a {<br />
            display: block;<br />
            padding: 6px 12px;<br />
            text-decoration: none;<br />
            } }</code
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll notice that the ul, li, and a selectors are nested inside the
          nav selector. This is a great way to organize your CSS and make it
          more readable.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="partials" class="main-section">
        <header>
          Partials
        </header>
        <p>
          You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS
          that you can include in other Sass files.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier
          to maintain. A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore.
          You might name it something like <code>_partial.scss.</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and
          that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are
          used with the <code>@use</code> rule.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="extend/inheritance" class="main-section">
        <header>
          Extend/Inheritance
        </header>
        <p>
          This is one of the most useful features of Sass. Using @extend lets
          you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. It
          helps keep your Sass very DRY. In our example we're going to create a
          simple series of messaging for errors, warnings and successes using
          another feature which goes hand in hand with extend, placeholder
          classes
        </p>
        <p>
          A placeholder class is a special type of class that only prints when
          it is extended, and can help keep your compiled CSS neat and clean.
        </p>
        <p>
          SCSS <br />
          <code>
            /* This CSS will print because %message-shared is extended. */
            %message-shared { border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; color:
            #333; } // This CSS won't print because %equal-heights is never
            extended. %equal-heights { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; }
            .message { @extend %message-shared; } .success { @extend
            %message-shared; border-color: green; } .error { @extend
            %message-shared; border-color: red; } .warning { @extend
            %message-shared; border-color: yellow; }
          </code>
